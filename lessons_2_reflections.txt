What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	git init creates an empty repository ready for new files to be added. We need to initialize a repository in order to track changes on our files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is a place where you put the files that you want to keep track of before commiting them to the repository. It is like a buffer area between the working directory and the repository.
