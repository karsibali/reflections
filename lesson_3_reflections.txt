When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  There may be several different occasions where you will need to keep a remote reposityory. 
  This need can occur when you work on different computers and you want to automatically 
  synchronize your project on all computers you work. Another ocassion can be when you 
  work on a project as a team. This way multiple persons can work on the same project 
  without anyl issues.
